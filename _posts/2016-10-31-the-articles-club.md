        <h2>The Task</h2>
        <p>
            The Articles Club is a modern twist on the classic book club, for short form content. We were tasked with taking that idea, and creating a solution that drives engagement in a medium other than the typical blog.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
            With sharing and community in mind, we took to leveraging social media (namely Twitter) to provide the architecture for the club. Embracing that, the website serves as a hub for potential members to look in, join, and stay informed. The branding focuses on marrying the old with the new, represented with the juxtaposition of chiseled serif typography and chunky, grotesque sans-serif headlines. Clean, simple, and direct.
