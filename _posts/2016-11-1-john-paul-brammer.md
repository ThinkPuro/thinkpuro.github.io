        <h2>The Task</h2>
        <p>Freelance writer John Paul Brammer asked us to create a portfolio website that could be a comprehensive “home base” for readers and potential employers.

    <div class="col">
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>What made John stand out to us was his online persona. He was able to seriously speak about social issues while also remaining humorous and snarky. We wanted to showcase those parts of John’s personality both visually and through content. The result was a dynamic hub, where readers/employers could interact with John’s content and immediately get a sense of his voice.
